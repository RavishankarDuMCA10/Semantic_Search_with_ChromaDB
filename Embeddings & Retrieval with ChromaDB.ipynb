Filming was scheduled to begin on March 29, 1971, with the scene between Michael Corleone and Kay Adams as they leave Best & Co. in New York City after shopping for Christmas gifts. The weather on March 23 predicted snow flurries, which caused Ruddy to move the filming date forward; snow did not materialize and a snow machine was used. Principal filming in New York continued until July 2, 1971. Coppola asked for a three-week break before heading overseas to film in Sicily. Following the crew's departure for Sicily, Paramount announced that the release date would be moved to early 1972.\\nCinematographer Gordon Willis initially turned down the opportunity to film The Godfather because the production seemed \\\"chaotic\\\" to him. After Willis later accepted the offer, he and Coppola agreed to not use any modern filming devices, helicopters, or zoom lenses. Willis and Coppola chose to use a \\\"tableau format\\\" of filming to make it seem as if it was viewed like a painting. He made use of shadows and low light levels throughout the film to showcase psychological developments. Willis and Coppola agreed to interplay light and dark scenes throughout the film. Willis underexposed the film in order to create a \\\"yellow tone\\\". The scenes in Sicily were shot to display the countryside and \\\"display a more romantic land,\\\" giving these scenes a \\\"softer, more romantic\\\" feel than the New York scenes.\\nOne of the film's most shocking moments involved an actual severed horse's head. The filming location for this scene is contested, as some sources indicate it was filmed at the Beverly Estate, while others indicate it was filmed at Sands Point Preserve on Long Island. Coppola received some criticism for the scene, although the head was obtained from a dog-food company from a horse that was to be killed regardless of the film.  On June 22, the scene where Sonny is killed was shot on a runway at Mitchel Field in Uniondale, where three tollbooths were built, along with guard rails, and billboards to set the scene. Sonny's car was a 1941 Lincoln Continental with holes drilled in it to resemble bullet holes. The scene took three days to film and cost over $100,000.Coppola's request to film on location was observed; approximately 90 percent was shot in New York City and its surrounding suburbs, using over 120 distinct locations. Several scenes were filmed at Filmways in East Harlem. The remaining portions were filmed in California, or on-site in Sicily. The scenes set in Las Vegas were not shot on location because there were insufficient funds. Savoca and Forza d'Agr\\u00f2 were the Sicilian towns featured in the film. The opening wedding scene was shot in a Staten Island neighborhood using almost 750 locals as extras. The house used as the Corleone household and the wedding location was at 110 Longfellow Avenue in the Todt Hill neighborhood of Staten Island. The wall around the Corleone compound was made from styrofoam. Scenes set in and around the Corleone olive oil business were filmed on Mott Street.After filming had ended on August 7, post-production efforts were focused on trimming the film to a manageable length. In addition, producers and director were still including and removing different scenes from the end product, along with trimming certain sequences. In September, the first rough cut of the film was viewed. Many of the scenes removed from the film were centered around Sonny, which did not advance the plot. By November, Coppola and Ruddy finished the semi-final cut. Debates over personnel involved with the final editing remained even 25 years after the release of the film. The film was shown to Paramount staff and exhibitors in late December 1971 and January 1972.\",\n          \"In October 2006, location scouting for Gotham City took place in the UK in Liverpool, Glasgow, London, and parts of Yorkshire, and in several cities in the U.S. Christopher chose Chicago because he liked the area and believed it offered interesting architectural features without being as recognizable as locations in better-known cities such as New York City. Chicagoan authorities had been supportive during filming of Batman Begins, allowing the production to shut stretches of roads, freeways, and bridges. Christopher wanted to exchange the more natural, scenic settings of Batman Begins such as the Himalayas and caverns for a modern, structured environment the Joker could disassemble. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the clean, neat lines of Chicagoan architecture enhanced the urban-crime drama they wanted to make, and that the Batman had helped improve the city. The destruction of Wayne Manor in Batman Begins provided an opportunity to move Wayne to a modern, sparse penthouse, reflecting his loneliness. Sets were still used for some interiors such as the Bat Bunker, the replacement for the Batcave, on the outskirts of the city. The production team considered placing it in the penthouse basement but believed it was too unrealistic a solution.Much of The Dark Knight was filmed using Panavision's Panaflex Millennium XL and Platinum cameras but Christopher wanted to film about 40 minutes with IMAX cameras, a high-resolution technology using 70 mm film rather than the more-commonly used format 35 mm; the finished film includes 15\\u201320% IMAX footage, running for about 28 minutes. This made it the first major motion picture to use IMAX technology, which was generally employed for documentaries. Warner Bros. was reluctant to endorse the use of the technology because the cameras were large and unwieldy, and purchasing and processing the film stock cost up to four times as much as typical 35 mm film. Christopher said cameras that could be used on Mount Everest could be used for The Dark Knight, and had cinematographer Wally Pfister and his crew begin training to use the equipment in January 2007 to test its feasibility. Christopher particularly wanted to film the bank heist prologue in IMAX to immediately convey the difference in scope between The Dark Knight and Batman Begins.\",\n          \"During the film's original theatrical release, the original negatives were worn down due to the reel being printed so much to meet demand. In addition, the duplicate negative was lost in Paramount archives. In 2006 Coppola contacted Steven Spielberg\\u2014whose studio DreamWorks had recently been bought out by Paramount\\u2014about restoring The Godfather. Robert A. Harris was hired to oversee the restoration of The Godfather and its two sequels, with the film's cinematographer Willis participating in the restoration. Work began in November 2006 by repairing the negatives so they could go through a digital scanner to produce high resolution 4K files. If a negative were damaged and discolored, work was done digitally to restore it to its original look. After a year and a half of working on the restoration, the project was complete. Paramount called the finished product The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration and released it to the public on September 23, 2008, on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Dave Kehr of The New York Times believed the restoration brought back the \\\"golden glow of their original theatrical screenings\\\". As a whole, the restoration of the film was well received by critics and Coppola. The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration contains several new special features that play in high definition, (including additional scenes, behind the scenes footage, etc.).Paramount Pictures restored and remastered The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (a re-edited cut of the third film) for a limited theatrical run and home media release on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the premiere of The Godfather. The disc editions were released on March 22, 2022.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Embeddings\",\n

The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.\\nDarabont purchased the film rights to King\\'s story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film\\'s score.\\nWhile The Shawshank Redemption received critical acclaim upon its release—particularly for its story, the performances of Robbins and Freeman, Newman\\'s score, Darabont\\'s direction and screenplay and Roger Deakins\\' cinematography—the film was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from the films Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film\\'s box-office gross to $73.3 million.\\nOver 320,000 VHS rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after its release, the film was still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the most \"beloved\" films ever made. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".',\n","  'In early 1947, Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne arrives at Shawshank State Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis \"Red\" Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently sexually assaulted by \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs Diamond.\\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a front to use Andy\\'s financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison\\'s decrepit library.\\nBrooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is punished with solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\".\\nIn 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young prisoner incarcerated for burglary. A year later, Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (GED) exam. Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders of which Andy was convicted. Andy brings the information to Norton who refuses to listen and, when Andy mentions the money laundering, sends Andy to solitary confinement and has Hadley fatally shoot Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy\\'s protection by the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican town on the Pacific coast. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near Buxton, asking Red to promise, once he is released, to retrieve a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy\\'s mental well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for some rope.\\nAt the next day\\'s roll call, the guards find Andy\\'s cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the past 19 years. The previous night, Andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton\\'s suit, shoes, and ledger, containing evidence of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens, withdraws over $370,000 of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\\nThe following year, Red is paroled after serving 40 years but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Fort Hancock, Texas, and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy sanding an old boat on a Zihuatanejo beach, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.',\n","  'Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne: A banker sentenced to life in prison in 1947 for the murder of his wife and her lover\\nMorgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding: A prison contraband smuggler who befriends Andy\\nBob Gunton as Samuel Norton: The pious and cruel warden of Shawshank penitentiary\\nWilliam Sadler as Heywood: A member of Red\\'s gang of long-serving convicts\\nClancy Brown as Byron Hadley: The brutal captain of the prison guards\\nGil Bellows as Tommy Williams: A young convict imprisoned for burglary in 1965\\nJames Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen: The elderly prison librarian, imprisoned at Shawshank for over five decadesThe cast also includes Mark Rolston as Bogs Diamond, the head of \"the Sisters\" gang and a prison rapist; Jeffrey DeMunn as the prosecuting attorney in Dufresne\\'s trial; Alfonso Freeman as Fresh Fish Con; Ned Bellamy and Don McManus as, respectively, prison guards Youngblood and Wiley; and Dion Anderson as Head Bull Haig. Renee Blaine portrays Andy\\'s wife, and Scott Mann portrays her golf-instructor lover Glenn Quentin. Frank Medrano plays Fat Ass, one of Andy\\'s fellow new inmates who is beaten to death by Hadley, and Bill Bolender plays Elmo Blatch, a convict who may actually be responsible for the crimes for which Andy is convicted. James Kisicki and Claire Slemmer portray the Maine National Bank manager and a teller, respectively.',\n","  'The film has been interpreted as being grounded in Christian mysticism. Andy is offered as a messianic, Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank. The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of the Last Supper, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the \"lords of all creation\" invoking Jesus\\' blessing. Director Frank Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film. The discovery of The Marriage of Figaro record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the Holy Grail, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.Early in the film, Warden Norton quotes Jesus Christ to describe himself to Andy, saying, \"I am the light of the world\", declaring himself Andy\\'s savior, but this description can also reference Lucifer, the bearer of light. Indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments as he sees fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of Satan. The warden has also been compared to former United States President Richard Nixon. Norton\\'s appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon\\'s. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those of which Nixon was accused.\\nZihuatanejo has been interpreted as an analog for heaven or paradise. In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name means \"peaceful\". The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised after Andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife\\'s death. Similarly, Red\\'s freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red\\'s story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy who finds redemption. While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, film critic Mark Kermode wrote that it can also be interpreted as a Nietzschean form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy\\'s aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he can be seen as a Zarathustra-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom. Film critic Roger Ebert argued that The Shawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining one\\'s feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy\\'s integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.Robbins himself believes that the concept of Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever \"jail\" someone finds themselves in, whether a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us. Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or imprisoned, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red\\'s belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money-laundering scam.Many elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject that is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. At the end of the film, Andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately Shawshank.Andy and Red\\'s relationship has been described as a nonsexual story between two men, that few other films offer, as the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy and Red\\'s true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.',\n","  'Darabont first collaborated with author Stephen King in 1983 on the short film adaptation of \"The Woman in the Room\", buying the rights from him for $1—a Dollar Deal that King used to help new directors build a résumé by adapting his short stories. After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Darabont returned to King with $5,000 to purchase the rights to adapt Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, a 96-page novella from King\\'s 1982 collection Different Seasons, written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known. Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could be turned into a feature film, Darabont believed it was \"obvious\". King never cashed the $5,000 check from Darabont; he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: \"In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve.\"Five years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. He expanded on elements of King\\'s story. Brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King\\'s story. Darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist. Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director Frank Capra, including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) and It\\'s a Wonderful Life (1946), describing them as tall tales; Darabont likened The Shawshank Redemption to a tall tale more than a prison movie. He also cited Goodfellas (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script, and the prison drama Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) directed by John Frankenheimer. While later scouting filming locations, Darabont happened upon Frankenheimer who was scouting for his own prison-set project Against the Wall. Darabont recalled that Frankenheimer took time out from his scouting to provide Darabont with encouragement and advice.At the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box-office successes, but Darabont\\'s script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King\\'s 1982 novella The Body into the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.Castle Rock offered to finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway, but he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 Variety interview, \"you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do\". Reiner served as Darabont\\'s mentor on the project, instead. Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits), and pre-production began in January 1993.',\n","  'Freeman was cast at the suggestion of producer Liz Glotzer, who ignored the novella\\'s character description of a white Irishman, nicknamed \"Red\". Freeman\\'s character alludes to the choice when queried by Andy on why he is called Red, replying \"Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m Irish.\" Freeman opted not to research his role, saying \"acting the part of someone who\\'s incarcerated doesn\\'t require any specific knowledge of incarceration ... because men don\\'t change. Once you\\'re in that situation, you just toe whatever line you have to toe.\" Darabont was already aware of Freeman from his minor role in another prison drama, Brubaker (1980), while Robbins had been excited to work alongside the actor, having grown up watching him in The Electric Company children\\'s television show.Darabont looked initially at some of his favorite actors, such as Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall, for the role of Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role—Hanks due to his starring role in Forrest Gump, and Costner because he had the lead in Waterworld. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and Charlie Sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but declined to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror Jacob\\'s Ladder. When Robbins was cast, he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked with him on The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.Cast initially as young convict Tommy, Brad Pitt dropped out following his success in Thelma & Louise, and the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows. James Gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming Demolition Man (1993) when he went to audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer Niki Marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from Demolition Man. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his Demolition Man role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film\\'s early scenes until his hair regrew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character, which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins\\', allowing Andy to believably use the warden\\'s suit.Portraying the head guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown was given the opportunity to speak with former guards by the production\\'s liaison officer but declined, believing it would not be a good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the Tales from the Crypt television series, where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Freeman\\'s son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in mug shot photos, and as a prisoner shouting \"fresh fish\" as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility. The novella\\'s original title attracted several people to audition for the nonexistent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man in drag clothing.',\n","  'On a $25 million budget, principal photography took place over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, \"Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those.\" Freeman referred to Darabont\\'s requiring multiple takes of scenes, which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film and featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, \"A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs.\" He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing the outside of the prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.Marvin spent five months scouting prisons across the United States and Canada, looking for a site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, to serve as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. The facility had been shuttered three years earlier in 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.The 15-acre reformatory, housing its own power plant and farm, was partially torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cellblocks. Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden\\'s office, were shot in the reformatory. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on a sound stage built inside a nearby shuttered Westinghouse Electric factory. Since Darabont wanted the inmates\\' cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-built set housed in the Westinghouse factory, except for the scene featuring Elmo Blatch\\'s admission of guilt for the crimes for which Andy was convicted. It was filmed in one of the actual prison\\'s more confined cells. Scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring Ashland, Ohio. The oak tree under which Andy buries his letter to Red was located near Malabar Farm State Park, in Lucas, Ohio; it was destroyed by winds in 2016.\\nJust as a prison in Ohio stood in for a fictional one in Maine, the beach scene showing Andy and Red\\'s reunion in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, was actually shot in the Caribbean on the island of Saint Croix, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The beach at \\'Zihuatanejo\\' is the Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area for leatherback sea turtles. Scenes shot in Upper Sandusky included the prison wood shop scene where Red and his fellow inmates hear The Marriage of Figaro (the woodshop is now called the Shawshank Woodshop), and the opening court scene which was shot at the Wyandot County Courthouse. Other shooting locations included Pugh Cabin in Malabar Farm State Park, where Andy sits outside as his wife engages in an affair, Butler, Ohio, stood in for Buxton, Maine, and the Bissman Building in Mansfield served as the halfway house where Brooks stayed following his release.For the scene depicting Andy\\'s escape from the prison, Darabont envisioned Andy using his miniature rock hammer to break into the sewage pipe, but he determined that this was not realistic. He opted instead to use a large piece of rock. While the film portrays the iconic scene of Andy escaping to freedom through a sewer pipe described as a \"river of shit\", Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. The production team dammed the stream to make it deeper and used chlorination to partially decontaminate it. Of the scene, Robbins said, \"when you\\'re doing a film, you want to be a good soldier—you don\\'t want to be the one [who] gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety.\" The scene was intended to be much longer and more dramatic, detailing Andy\\'s escape across a field and onto a train, but with only a single night available to film the sequence, it was shortened to showing Andy standing triumphant in the water. Of his own work, Deakins considers the scene to be one of his least favorite, saying that he \"over-lit\" it. In response, Darabont disagreed with Deakins\\' self-assessment. He said that the time and precision taken by Deakins, and their limited filming schedule, meant he had to be precise in what he could film and how. In a 2019 interview, he stated that he regretted that this meant he could not film a close up of Robbins\\' face as he climbed down out of the hole from his cell.As for the scene where Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins\\' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder\\'s The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. As the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, producer Niki Marvin approached The Shawshank Redemption\\'s domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, which offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was Gilda. As filming took place mainly in and around the prison, scenes were often shot in near chronological order respective of the different eras depicted throughout the story. This aided the actors\\' performances as their real-life relationships evolved alongside those of their respective characters. Darabont commented that the scene in which Andy tells Red about his dreams of going to Mexico, was one of the last filmed and one that he most revisited in recollecting on the film\\'s production. He praised Robbins and Freeman for completing the scene in only a few takes.',\n","  'The final cut of the theatrically released film runs for 142 minutes, and was dedicated to Allen Greene, Darabont\\'s former agent, who died during filming from AIDS. The film\\'s first edit ran for nearly two and a half hours, which Glotzer considered \"long\", and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of Red adjusting to life after incarceration; Darabont said that in test screenings the audience seemed to be getting impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that Red would not make it. Another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating Andy\\'s escape tunnel; this was thought to slow down the action. The film originally had a cold open that played out Andy\\'s crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more \"punchy\" opening. One scripted scene, which Darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule. In the scene, a dreaming Red is sucked into the poster of Rita Hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the Pacific shore, saying \"I am terrified, there is no way home.\" Darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.In Darabont\\'s original vision for the end of the film, Red is seen riding a bus towards the Mexican border, leaving his fate ambiguous. Glotzer insisted on including the scene of Red and Andy reuniting in Zihuatanejo. She said Darabont felt this was a \"commercial, sappy\" ending, but Glotzer wanted the audience to see them together. Castle Rock agreed to finance filming for the scene without requiring its inclusion, guaranteeing Darabont the final decision. The scene originally featured a longer reunion in which Andy and Red recited dialogue from their first meeting, but Darabont said it had a \"golly-gee-ain\\'t-we-cute\" quality and excised it. The beach reunion was test audiences\\' favorite scene; both Freeman and Robbins felt it provided the necessary closure. Darabont agreed to include the scene after seeing the test audience reactions, saying: \"I think it\\'s a magical and uplifting place for our characters to arrive at the end of their long saga...\"',\n","  'The film\\'s score was composed by Thomas Newman. He felt that it already elicited such strong emotions without music that he found it difficult to compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, \"Shawshank Redemption\", plays during Andy\\'s escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a \"triumphal flourish\" and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. \"So Was Red\", played following Red\\'s release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy\\'s cache, became one of Newman\\'s favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add harmonica—a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his message of hope. According to Darabont, harmonica player Tommy Morgan \"casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take\", and this is heard in the finished film. Newman\\'s score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.',\n","  'Leading up to its release, the film was test screened with the public. These were described as \"through the roof\", and Glotzer said they were some of the best she had seen. It was decided to mostly omit Stephen King\\'s name from any advertising, as the studio wanted to attract a \"more prestigious audience\", who might reject a film from a writer known mostly for pulp fiction works such as The Shining and Cujo.Following early September premieres at the Renaissance Theatre in Mansfield, and the Toronto International Film Festival, The Shawshank Redemption began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the Los Angeles Times pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number-nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy Exit to Eden ($3 million), and just ahead of the historical drama Quiz Show ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. The Shawshank Redemption closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a box-office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors\\' cuts.The film was also competing with Pulp Fiction ($108 million), which also premiered October 14 following its Palme d\\'Or award win, and Forrest Gump ($330 million), which was in the middle of a successful 42-week theatrical run. Both films would become quotable cultural phenomena. A general audience trend towards action films starring the likes of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger was also considered to work against the commercial success of The Shawshank Redemption. Freeman blamed the title, saying it was unmemorable, while Robbins recalled fans asking: \"What was that Shinkshonk Reduction thing?\". Several alternative titles had been posited before the release due to concerns that it was not a marketable title. The low box office was also blamed on a lack of female characters to broaden the audience demographics, the general unpopularity of prison films, and the bleak tone used in its marketing.After being nominated for several Oscars in early 1995, the film was re-released between February and March, earning a further $12 million. In total, the film grossed $28.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $45 million from other markets for a worldwide total of $73.3 million. In the United States, it became the 51st-highest-grossing film of 1994, and the 21st-highest-grossing R-rated film of 1994.'],\n"," 'uris': None,\n"," 'data': None,\n"," 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None],\n"," 'included': [<IncludeEnum.embeddings: 'embeddings'>,\n","  <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>,\n","  <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Retrieve items from the collection\n","\n","collection.get(\n","    ids = ['0','1']\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"tKzb1a6Cd4wm","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742656149517,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":25,"user":{"displayName":"RaviShankar Kushwaha","userId":"11203985744323442956"}},"outputId":"39a9c46b-e20a-4e81-b631-1e7aa5ac3414","collapsed":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'ids': ['0', '1'],\n"," 'embeddings': None,\n"," 'documents': ['The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American prison drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.\\nDarabont purchased the film rights to King\\'s story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film\\'s score.\\nWhile The Shawshank Redemption received critical acclaim upon its release—particularly for its story, the performances of Robbins and Freeman, Newman\\'s score, Darabont\\'s direction and screenplay and Roger Deakins\\' cinematography—the film was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from the films Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film\\'s box-office gross to $73.3 million.\\nOver 320,000 VHS rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after its release, the film was still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the most \"beloved\" films ever made. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".',\n","  'In early 1947, Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne arrives at Shawshank State Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis \"Red\" Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently sexually assaulted by \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs Diamond.\\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a front to use Andy\\'s financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison\\'s decrepit library.\\nBrooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is punished with solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\".\\nIn 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young prisoner incarcerated for burglary. A year later, Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (GED) exam. Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders of which Andy was convicted. Andy brings the information to Norton who refuses to listen and, when Andy mentions the money laundering, sends Andy to solitary confinement and has Hadley fatally shoot Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy\\'s protection by the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican town on the Pacific coast. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near Buxton, asking Red to promise, once he is released, to retrieve a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy\\'s mental well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for some rope.\\nAt the next day\\'s roll call, the guards find Andy\\'s cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the past 19 years. The previous night, Andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton\\'s suit, shoes, and ledger, containing evidence of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens, withdraws over $370,000 of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\\nThe following year, Red is paroled after serving 40 years but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Fort Hancock, Texas, and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy sanding an old boat on a Zihuatanejo beach, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.'],\n"," 'uris': None,\n"," 'data': None,\n"," 'metadatas': [None, None],\n"," 'included': [<IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>,\n","  <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Add only the documents and ids into the collection, and ChromaDB will create embeddings on its own using the default embedding model - 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'\n","\n","temp_collection = chroma_client.get_or_create_collection(name=\"Temporary\")\n","documents = ['Generative AI is an exciting space!', 'Generative AI encompasses all modalities including LLMs', 'Can Generative AI take my job?']\n","collection.add(\n","    documents = documents,\n","    ids = [str(i) for i in range(0, len(documents))],\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"inZrUNNRfqdF","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742656155524,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3783,"user":{"displayName":"RaviShankar Kushwaha","userId":"11203985744323442956"}},"outputId":"8c29cab7-1001-40de-dc97-719f294e5dbf"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/root/.cache/chroma/onnx_models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/onnx.tar.gz: 100%|██████████| 79.3M/79.3M [00:01<00:00, 73.9MiB/s]\n","WARNING:chromadb.segment.impl.metadata.sqlite:Insert of existing embedding ID: 0\n","WARNING:chromadb.segment.impl.metadata.sqlite:Insert of existing embedding ID: 1\n","WARNING:chromadb.segment.impl.metadata.sqlite:Insert of existing embedding ID: 2\n","WARNING:chromadb.segment.impl.vector.local_persistent_hnsw:Add of existing embedding ID: 0\n","WARNING:chromadb.segment.impl.vector.local_persistent_hnsw:Add of existing embedding ID: 1\n","WARNING:chromadb.segment.impl.vector.local_persistent_hnsw:Add of existing embedding ID: 2\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# List all the collection created\n","\n","chroma_client.list_collections()"],"metadata":{"id":"0UfAfXVAfl2H","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742656188050,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"RaviShankar Kushwaha","userId":"11203985744323442956"}},"outputId":"d56e15e5-1f04-48e0-c118-ebe8af044bf7"},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Temporary', 'Semantic_Search_with_Chromadb']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Delete a collection\n","\n","chroma_client.delete_collection(\"Temporary\")"],"metadata":{"id":"g8R8EOamgSiC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742656597300,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":31,"user":{"displayName":"RaviShankar Kushwaha","userId":"11203985744323442956"}}},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### <font color = red> 2.2 Querying on ChromaDB </font>\n","\n","* **`collection.query()`**"],"metadata":{"id":"cpwkYpDJSs0G"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Read the query from the user\n","query = input()\n","\n","# Query the ChromaDB collection using `collection.query()\n","results = collection.query(\n","    query_texts=query,\n","    n_results=3,\n","    include = ['documents', 'distances']\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"F1-Ji2epiKj7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742656830819,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":178640,"user":{"displayName":"RaviShankar Kushwaha","userId":"11203985744323442956"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"43d62a59-ff46-4783-f805-f4c7b9882a71"},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Who is the director of pulp fiction?\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# !pip install -U -q sentence-\n","# # Encode query using Sentence Transformer model\n","# from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n","\n","# model_name = \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"\n","# embedder = SentenceTransformer(model_name)\n","# query_embedding = embedder.encode(query)"],"metadata":{"id":"ug80fwrvrYOo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742656860722,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":37,"user":{"displayName":"RaviShankar Kushwaha","userId":"11203985744323442956"}}},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# See the results\n","\n","results"],"metadata":{"id":"A7URCUg5NjnH","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742656861441,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"RaviShankar Kushwaha","userId":"11203985744323442956"}},"outputId":"3898f23d-04c6-4288-89a3-dde7ae1c2b69"},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'ids': [['40', '48', '45']],\n"," 'embeddings': None,\n"," 'documents': [['Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino from a story he conceived with Roger Avary. It tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles, California. The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\\nTarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp.\" Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character\\'s perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented.\" Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.\\nPulp Fiction won the Palme d\\'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers. Its development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.\\nPulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino\\'s magnum opus, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman, and Jackson earning particular acclaim. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics\\' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"',\n","   'Pulp Fiction premiered in May 1994 at the Cannes Film Festival. The Weinsteins \"hit the beach like commandos\", bringing the picture\\'s entire cast over. The film was unveiled at a midnight hour screening and caused a sensation It won the Palme d\\'Or, the festival\\'s top prize, generating a further wave of publicity.The first U.S. review of the film was published on May 23 in industry trade magazine Variety. Todd McCarthy called Pulp Fiction a \"spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture ... a startling, massive success.\" From Cannes forward, Tarantino was on the road continuously, promoting the film. Over the next few months it played in smaller festivals around Europe, building buzz: Nottingham, Munich, Taormina, Locarno, Norway, and San Sebastián. Tarantino later said, \"One thing that\\'s cool is that by breaking up the linear structure, when I watch the film with an audience, it does break [the audience\\'s] alpha state. It\\'s like, all of a sudden, \\'I gotta watch this ... I gotta pay attention.\\' You can almost feel everybody moving in their seats. It\\'s actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie.\" In late September, it opened the New York Film Festival. The New York Times published its review the day of the opening. Janet Maslin called the film a \"triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino\\'s ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color ... [He] has come up with a work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers.\"On October 14, 1994, Pulp Fiction went into general release in the United States. As Peter Biskind describes, \"It was not platformed, that is, it did not open in a handful of theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built, the traditional way of releasing an indie film; it went wide immediately, into 1,100 theaters.\" In the eyes of some cultural critics, Reservoir Dogs had given Tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence. Miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign: \"You won\\'t know the facts till you\\'ve seen the fiction\", went one slogan. Pulp Fiction was the top-grossing film at the US box office its first weekend with a gross of $9,311,882, edging out a Sylvester Stallone vehicle, The Specialist, which was in its second week and playing at more than twice as many theaters. The gross claimed by Miramax was disputed by others. Warner Bros. initially reported an estimated gross of $8.9 million for The Specialist with Bob Weinstein then reporting a gross for Pulp Fiction of $9.1 million, claiming that the film was on another 100 screens that had previously been overlooked. Warners then updated their gross to $9.3 million, claiming they had made a calculation error.\\nEarly Monday morning, Miramax reported a gross of $9.3 million with Warners reporting $8.9 million for The Specialist, placing Pulp Fiction first but other industry sources did not believe Miramax\\'s numbers. Variety estimated that Pulp Fiction grossed $8.6 to $9 million for the weekend.Against its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs, Pulp Fiction grossed $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first \"indie\" film to surpass $100 million. Worldwide, it took in nearly $213 million. In terms of domestic grosses, it was the tenth biggest film of 1994, even though it played on substantially fewer screens than any other film in the top 20. Popular engagement with the film, such as speculation about the contents of the precious briefcase, \"indicates the kind of cult status that Pulp Fiction achieved almost immediately.\" As MovieMaker puts it, \"The movie was nothing less than a national cultural phenomenon.\" Abroad, as well: in Britain, where it opened a week after its U.S. release, not only was the film a big hit, but in book form its screenplay became the most successful in UK publishing history, a top-ten bestseller.',\n","   'Tarantino and his producer, Lawrence Bender, brought the script to Jersey Films. Before even seeing Reservoir Dogs, Jersey had attempted to sign Tarantino for his next project. Ultimately a development deal worth around $1 million had been struck: The deal gave A Band Apart, Bender and Tarantino\\'s newly formed production company, initial financing and office facilities; Jersey got a share of the project and the right to shop the script to a studio. Jersey had a distribution and \"first look\" deal with Columbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option. In February, Pulp Fiction appeared on a Variety list of films in pre-production at TriStar. In June, however, the studio put the script into turnaround. According to a studio executive, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy found it \"too demented\". There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image. Avary – who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut, Killing Zoe – has said that TriStar\\'s objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script\\'s fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio\\'s position: \"\\'This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone\\'s dead and then they\\'re alive. It\\'s too long, violent, and unfilmable.\\' ... So I thought, \\'That\\'s that!\\'\"Bender brought the script to Miramax, the formerly independent studio that had recently been acquired by Disney. Harvey Weinstein – co-chairman of Miramax, along with his brother Bob – was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up. Pulp Fiction, the first Miramax project to get a green light after the Disney acquisition, was budgeted at $8.5 million. It became the first movie that Miramax completely financed. Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week, regardless of their industry status. The New York Times reported, \"Most of the actors received relatively small salaries along with a percentage of the profits.\" The biggest star to sign on to the project was Bruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, he was still a major overseas draw.

It tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles, California. The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\\nTarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \\\"pulp.\\\" Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \\\"too demented.\\\" Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.\\nPulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers. Its development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.\\nPulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino's magnum opus, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman, and Jackson earning particular acclaim. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\\"\",\n          \"Pulp Fiction premiered in May 1994 at the Cannes Film Festival. The Weinsteins \\\"hit the beach like commandos\\\", bringing the picture's entire cast over. The film was unveiled at a midnight hour screening and caused a sensation It won the Palme d'Or, the festival's top prize, generating a further wave of publicity.The first U.S. review of the film was published on May 23 in industry trade magazine Variety. Todd McCarthy called Pulp Fiction a \\\"spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture ... a startling, massive success.\\\" From Cannes forward, Tarantino was on the road continuously, promoting the film. Over the next few months it played in smaller festivals around Europe, building buzz: Nottingham, Munich, Taormina, Locarno, Norway, and San Sebasti\\u00e1n. Tarantino later said, \\\"One thing that's cool is that by breaking up the linear structure, when I watch the film with an audience, it does break [the audience's] alpha state. It's like, all of a sudden, 'I gotta watch this ... I gotta pay attention.' You can almost feel everybody moving in their seats. It's actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie.\\\" In late September, it opened the New York Film Festival. The New York Times published its review the day of the opening. Janet Maslin called the film a \\\"triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color ... [He] has come up with a work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers.\\\"On October 14, 1994, Pulp Fiction went into general release in the United States. As Peter Biskind describes, \\\"It was not platformed, that is, it did not open in a handful of theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built, the traditional way of releasing an indie film; it went wide immediately, into 1,100 theaters.\\\" In the eyes of some cultural critics, Reservoir Dogs had given Tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence. Miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign: \\\"You won't know the facts till you've seen the fiction\\\", went one slogan. Pulp Fiction was the top-grossing film at the US box office its first weekend with a gross of $9,311,882, edging out a Sylvester Stallone vehicle, The Specialist, which was in its second week and playing at more than twice as many theaters. The gross claimed by Miramax was disputed by others. Warner Bros. initially reported an estimated gross of $8.9 million for The Specialist with Bob Weinstein then reporting a gross for Pulp Fiction of $9.1 million, claiming that the film was on another 100 screens that had previously been overlooked. Warners then updated their gross to $9.3 million, claiming they had made a calculation error.\\nEarly Monday morning, Miramax reported a gross of $9.3 million with Warners reporting $8.9 million for The Specialist, placing Pulp Fiction first but other industry sources did not believe Miramax's numbers. Variety estimated that Pulp Fiction grossed $8.6 to $9 million for the weekend.Against its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs, Pulp Fiction grossed $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first \\\"indie\\\" film to surpass $100 million. Worldwide, it took in nearly $213 million. In terms of domestic grosses, it was the tenth biggest film of 1994, even though it played on substantially fewer screens than any other film in the top 20. Popular engagement with the film, such as speculation about the contents of the precious briefcase, \\\"indicates the kind of cult status that Pulp Fiction achieved almost immediately.\\\" As MovieMaker puts it, \\\"The movie was nothing less than a national cultural phenomenon.\\\" Abroad, as well: in Britain, where it opened a week after its U.S. release, not only was the film a big hit, but in book form its screenplay became the most successful in UK publishing history, a top-ten bestseller.\",\n          \"Tarantino and his producer, Lawrence Bender, brought the script to Jersey Films. Before even seeing Reservoir Dogs, Jersey had attempted to sign Tarantino for his next project. Ultimately a development deal worth around $1 million had been struck: The deal gave A Band Apart, Bender and Tarantino's newly formed production company, initial financing and office facilities; Jersey got a share of the project and the right to shop the script to a studio. Jersey had a distribution and \\\"first look\\\" deal with Columbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option. In February, Pulp Fiction appeared on a Variety list of films in pre-production at TriStar. In June, however, the studio put the script into turnaround. According to a studio executive, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy found it \\\"too demented\\\". There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image. Avary \\u2013 who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut, Killing Zoe \\u2013 has said that TriStar's objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script's fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio's position: \\\"'This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent, and unfilmable.' ... So I thought, 'That's that!'\\\"Bender brought the script to Miramax, the formerly independent studio that had recently been acquired by Disney. Harvey Weinstein \\u2013 co-chairman of Miramax, along with his brother Bob \\u2013 was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up. Pulp Fiction, the first Miramax project to get a green light after the Disney acquisition, was budgeted at $8.5 million. It became the first movie that Miramax completely financed. Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week, regardless of their industry status. The New York Times reported, \\\"Most of the actors received relatively small salaries along with a percentage of the profits.\\\" The biggest star to sign on to the project was Bruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, he was still a major overseas draw.

cast received a two-week period for rehearsal, which included a dinner where each actor and actress had to assume character for its duration. filming was scheduled to begin on march 29, 1971, with the scene between michael corleone and kay adams as they leave best & co. in new york city after shopping for christmas gifts. the weather on march 23 predicted snow flurries, which caused ruddy to move the filming date forward; snow did not materialize and a snow machine was used. principal filming in new york continued until july 2, 1971. coppola asked for a three-week break before heading overseas to film in sicily. following the crew's departure for sicily, paramount announced that the release date would be moved to early 1972.\\ncinematographer gordon willis initially turned down the opportunity to film the godfather because the production seemed \\\"chaotic\\\" to him. after willis later accepted the offer, he and coppola agreed to not use any modern filming devices, helicopters, or zoom lenses. willis and coppola chose to use a \\\"tableau format\\\" of filming to make it seem as if it was viewed like a painting. he made use of shadows and low light levels throughout the film to showcase psychological developments. willis and coppola agreed to interplay light and dark scenes throughout the film. willis underexposed the film in order to create a \\\"yellow tone\\\". the scenes in sicily were shot to display the countryside and \\\"display a more romantic land,\\\" giving these scenes a \\\"softer, more romantic\\\" feel than the new york scenes.\\none of the film's most shocking moments involved an actual severed horse's head. the filming location for this scene is contested, as some sources indicate it was filmed at the beverly estate, while others indicate it was filmed at sands point preserve on long island. coppola received some criticism for the scene, although the head was obtained from a dog-food company from a horse that was to be killed regardless of the film.  on june 22, the scene where sonny is killed was shot on a runway at mitchel field in uniondale, where three tollbooths were built, along with guard rails, and billboards to set the scene. sonny's car was a 1941 lincoln continental with holes drilled in it to resemble bullet holes. the scene took three days to film and cost over $100,000.coppola's request to film on location was observed; approximately 90 percent was shot in new york city and its surrounding suburbs, using over 120 distinct locations. several scenes were filmed at filmways in east harlem. the remaining portions were filmed in california, or on-site in sicily. the scenes set in las vegas were not shot on location because there were insufficient funds. savoca and forza d'agr\\u00f2 were the sicilian towns featured in the film. the opening wedding scene was shot in a staten island neighborhood using almost 750 locals as extras. the house used as the corleone household and the wedding location was at 110 longfellow avenue in the todt hill neighborhood of staten island. the wall around the corleone compound was made from styrofoam. scenes set in and around the corleone olive oil business were filmed on mott street.after filming had ended on august 7, post-production efforts were focused on trimming the film to a manageable length. in addition, producers and director were still including and removing different scenes from the end product, along with trimming certain sequences. in september, the first rough cut of the film was viewed. many of the scenes removed from the film were centered around sonny, which did not advance the plot. by november, coppola and ruddy finished the semi-final cut. debates over personnel involved with the final editing remained even 25 years after the release of the film. the film was shown to paramount staff and exhibitors in late december 1971 and january 1972.\",\n          \"in october 2006, location scouting for gotham city took place in the uk in liverpool, glasgow, london, and parts of yorkshire, and in several cities in the u.s. christopher chose chicago because he liked the area and believed it offered interesting architectural features without being as recognizable as locations in better-known cities such as new york city. chicagoan authorities had been supportive during filming of batman begins, allowing the production to shut stretches of roads, freeways, and bridges. christopher wanted to exchange the more natural, scenic settings of batman begins such as the himalayas and caverns for a modern, structured environment the joker could disassemble. production designer nathan crowley said the clean, neat lines of chicagoan architecture enhanced the urban-crime drama they wanted to make, and that the batman had helped improve the city. the destruction of wayne manor in batman begins provided an opportunity to move wayne to a modern, sparse penthouse, reflecting his loneliness. sets were still used for some interiors such as the bat bunker, the replacement for the batcave, on the outskirts of the city. the production team considered placing it in the penthouse basement but believed it was too unrealistic a solution.much of the dark knight was filmed using panavision's panaflex millennium xl and platinum cameras but christopher wanted to film about 40 minutes with imax cameras, a high-resolution technology using 70 mm film rather than the more-commonly used format 35 mm; the finished film includes 15\\u201320% imax footage, running for about 28 minutes. this made it the first major motion picture to use imax technology, which was generally employed for documentaries. warner bros. was reluctant to endorse the use of the technology because the cameras were large and unwieldy, and purchasing and processing the film stock cost up to four times as much as typical 35 mm film. christopher said cameras that could be used on mount everest could be used for the dark knight, and had cinematographer wally pfister and his crew begin training to use the equipment in january 2007 to test its feasibility. christopher particularly wanted to film the bank heist prologue in imax to immediately convey the difference in scope between the dark knight and batman begins.\",\n          \"during the film's original theatrical release, the original negatives were worn down due to the reel being printed so much to meet demand. in addition, the duplicate negative was lost in paramount archives. in 2006 coppola contacted steven spielberg\\u2014whose studio dreamworks had recently been bought out by paramount\\u2014about restoring the godfather. robert a. harris was hired to oversee the restoration of the godfather and its two sequels, with the film's cinematographer willis participating in the restoration. work began in november 2006 by repairing the negatives so they could go through a digital scanner to produce high resolution 4k files. if a negative were damaged and discolored, work was done digitally to restore it to its original look. after a year and a half of working on the restoration, the project was complete. paramount called the finished product the godfather: the coppola restoration and released it to the public on september 23, 2008, on both dvd and blu-ray disc. dave kehr of the new york times believed the restoration brought back the \\\"golden glow of their original theatrical screenings\\\". as a whole, the restoration of the film was well received by critics and coppola. the godfather: the coppola restoration contains several new special features that play in high definition, (including additional scenes, behind the scenes footage, etc.).paramount pictures restored and remastered the godfather, the godfather part ii, and the godfather coda: the death of michael corleone (a re-edited cut of the third film) for a limited theatrical run and home media release on blu-ray and 4k blu-ray to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the premiere of the godfather. the disc editions were released on march 22, 2022.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

written and directed by frank darabont, based on the 1982 stephen king novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption. the film tells the story of banker andy dufresne (tim robbins), who is sentenced to life in shawshank state penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler ellis \"red\" redding (morgan freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden samuel norton (bob gunton). william sadler, clancy brown, gil bellows, and james whitmore appear in supporting roles.\\ndarabont purchased the film rights to king\\'s story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. two weeks after submitting his script to castle rock entertainment, darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce the shawshank redemption, which started pre-production in january 1993. while the film is set in maine, principal photography took place from june to august 1993 almost entirely in mansfield, ohio, with the ohio state reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. the project attracted many stars for the role of andy, including tom hanks, tom cruise, and kevin costner. thomas newman provided the film\\'s score.\\nwhile the shawshank redemption received critical acclaim upon its release—particularly for its story, the performances of robbins and freeman, newman\\'s score, darabont\\'s direction and screenplay and roger deakins\\' cinematography—the film was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from the films pulp fiction and forrest gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. it went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven academy award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film\\'s box-office gross to $73.3 million.\\nover 320,000 vhs rental copies were shipped throughout the united states, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. the broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of castle rock by turner broadcasting system, and it was shown regularly on the tnt network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. decades after its release, the film was still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the most \"beloved\" films ever made. in 2015, the united states library of congress selected the film for preservation in the

two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. he is befriended by ellis \"red\" redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a rock hammer and a large poster of rita hayworth for andy. assigned to work in the prison laundry, andy is frequently sexually assaulted by \"the sisters\" and their leader, bogs diamond.\\nin 1949, andy overhears the captain of the guards, byron hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. after an assault by the sisters nearly kills andy, hadley beats and cripples bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; andy is not attacked again. warden samuel norton meets andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate brooks hatlen, a front to use andy\\'s financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison\\'s decrepit library.\\nbrooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. the legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of the marriage of figaro; andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is punished with solitary confinement. after his release from solitary, andy explains to a dismissive red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. in 1963, norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. andy launders the money using the alias \"randall stephens\".\\nin 1965, andy and red befriend tommy williams, a young prisoner incarcerated for burglary. a year later, andy helps him pass his general educational development (ged) exam. tommy reveals to red and andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders of which andy was convicted. andy brings the information to norton who refuses to listen and, when andy mentions the money laundering, sends andy to solitary confinement and has hadley fatally shoot tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but norton threatens to destroy the library, remove andy\\'s protection by the guards, and move him to worse conditions. andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical red that he dreams of living in zihuatanejo, a mexican town on the pacific coast. andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near buxton, asking red to promise, once he is released, to retrieve a package that andy buried there. red worries about andy\\'s mental well-being, especially when he learns andy asked a fellow inmate for some rope.\\nat the next day\\'s roll call, the guards find andy\\'s cell empty. an irate norton throws a rock at a poster of raquel welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that andy had dug with his rock hammer over the past 19 years. the previous night, andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking norton\\'s suit, shoes, and ledger, containing evidence of the money laundering. while guards search for him, andy poses as randall stephens, withdraws over $370,000 of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at shawshank to a local newspaper. state police arrive at shawshank and take hadley into custody, while norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\\nthe following year, red is paroled after serving 40 years but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. remembering his promise to andy, he visits buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to zihuatanejo. red violates his parole by traveling to fort hancock, texas, and crossing the border into mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. he finds andy sanding an old boat on a zihuatanejo beach, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.',\n","  'tim robbins as andy dufresne: a banker sentenced to life in prison

for which andy is convicted. james kisicki and claire slemmer portray the maine national bank manager and a teller, respectively.',\n","  'the film has been interpreted as being grounded in christian mysticism. andy is offered as a messianic, christ-like figure, with red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from shawshank. the scene in which andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of the last supper, with andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as freeman describes them as the \"lords of all creation\" invoking jesus\\' blessing. director frank darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film. the discovery of the marriage of figaro record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the holy grail, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.early in the film, warden norton quotes jesus christ to describe himself to andy, saying, \"i am the light of the world\", declaring himself andy\\'s savior, but this description can also reference lucifer, the bearer of light. indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments as he sees fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of satan. the warden has also been compared to former united states president richard nixon. norton\\'s appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror nixon\\'s. similarly, norton projects an image of a holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those of which nixon was accused.\\nzihuatanejo has been interpreted as an analog for heaven or paradise. in the film, andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the pacific ocean, whose name means \"peaceful\". the possibility of escaping to zihuatanejo is only raised after andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife\\'s death. similarly, red\\'s freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. freeman has described red\\'s story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike andy who finds redemption. while some christian viewers interpret zihuatanejo as heaven, film critic mark kermode wrote that it can also be interpreted as a nietzschean form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning andy\\'s aim is secular and atheistic. just as andy can be interpreted as a christ-like figure, he can be seen as a zarathustra-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom. film critic roger ebert argued that the shawshank redemption is an allegory for maintaining one\\'s feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. andy\\'s integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.robbins himself believes that the concept of zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever \"jail\" someone finds themselves in, whether a bad relationship, job, or environment. robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us. isaac m. morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or imprisoned, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life. philosopher jean-paul sartre described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring red\\'s belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money-laundering scam.many elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. in the prison theater, the inmates watch the film gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature the lost weekend (1945). the interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject that is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. immediately following this scene, andy is assaulted by the sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. at the end of the film, andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately shawshank.andy and red\\'s relationship has been described as a nonsexual story between two men, that few other films offer, as the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. philosopher alexander hooke argued that andy and red\\'s true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.',\n","  'darabont first collaborated with author stephen king in 1983 on the short film adaptation of \"the woman in the room\", buying the rights from him for $1—a dollar deal that king used to help new directors build a résumé by adapting his short stories. after receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for a nightmare on elm street 3: dream warriors, darabont returned to king with $5,000 to purchase the rights to adapt rita hayworth and shawshank redemption, a 96-page novella from king\\'s 1982 collection different seasons, written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known. although king did not understand how the story, largely focused on red contemplating his fellow prisoner andy, could be turned into a feature film, darabont believed it was \"obvious\". king never cashed the $5,000 check from darabont; he later framed it and returned it to darabont accompanied by a note which read: \"in case you ever need bail money. love, steve.\"five years later, darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. he expanded on elements of king\\'s story. brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of warden norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in king\\'s story. darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist. among his inspirations, darabont listed the works of director frank capra, including mr. smith goes to washington (1939) and it\\'s a wonderful life (1946), describing them as tall tales; darabont likened the shawshank redemption to a tall tale more than a prison movie. he also cited goodfellas (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script, and the prison drama birdman of alcatraz (1962) directed by john frankenheimer. while later scouting filming locations, darabont happened upon frankenheimer who was scouting for his own prison-set project against the wall. darabont recalled that frankenheimer took time out from his scouting to provide darabont with encouragement and advice.at the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box-office successes, but darabont\\'s script was read by then-castle rock entertainment producer liz glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if castle rock did not produce the shawshank redemption. director and castle rock co-founder rob reiner also liked the script. he offered darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself. reiner, who had previously adapted king\\'s 1982 novella the body into the 1986 film stand by me, planned to cast tom cruise as andy and harrison ford as red.castle rock offered to finance any other film darabont wanted to develop. darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in los angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that castle rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to reiner anyway, but he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 variety interview, \"you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do\". reiner served as darabont\\'s mentor on the project, instead. within two weeks of showing the script to castle rock, darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits), and pre-production began in january 1993.',\n","  'freeman was cast at the suggestion of producer liz glotzer, who ignored the novella\\'s character description of a white irishman, nicknamed \"red\". freeman\\'s character alludes to the choice when queried by andy on why he is called red, replying \"maybe it\\'s because i\\'m irish.\" freeman opted not to research his role, saying \"acting the part of someone who\\'s incarcerated doesn\\'t require any specific knowledge of incarceration ... because men don\\'t change. once you\\'re in that situation, you just toe whatever line you have to toe.\" darabont was already aware of freeman from his minor role in another prison drama, brubaker (1980), while robbins had been excited to work alongside the actor, having grown up watching him in the electric company children\\'s television show.darabont looked initially at some of his favorite actors, such as gene hackman and robert duvall, for the role of andy dufresne, but they were unavailable; clint eastwood and paul newman were also considered. tom cruise, tom hanks, and kevin costner were offered, and passed on the role—hanks due to his starring role in forrest gump, and costner because he had the lead in waterworld. johnny depp, nicolas cage, and charlie sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. cruise attended table readings of the script, but declined to work for the inexperienced darabont. darabont said he cast robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror jacob\\'s ladder. when robbins was cast, he insisted that darabont use experienced cinematographer roger deakins, who had worked with him on the hudsucker proxy. to prepare for the role, robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.cast initially as young convict tommy, brad pitt dropped out following his success in thelma & louise, and the role went to a debuting gil bellows. james gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist bogs. bob gunton was filming demolition man (1993) when he went to audition for the role of warden norton. to convince the studio that gunton was right for the part, darabont and producer niki marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from demolition man. they had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his demolition man role. gunton wanted to portray norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. gunton performed his screen test with robbins, which was filmed by deakins. after being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film\\'s early scenes until his hair regrew. gunton said that marvin and darabont saw that he understood the character, which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to robbins\\', allowing andy to believably use the warden\\'s suit.portraying the head guard byron hadley, clancy brown was given the opportunity to speak with former guards by the production\\'s liaison officer but declined, believing it would not be a good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by ohio state correctional officers. william sadler, who portrays heywood, said that darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the tales from the crypt television series, where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. freeman\\'s son alfonso has a cameo as a young red in mug shot photos, and as a prisoner shouting \"fresh fish\" as andy arrives at shawshank. among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility. the novella\\'s original title attracted several people to audition for the nonexistent role of rita hayworth, including a man in drag clothing.',\n","  'on a $25 million budget, principal photography took place over three months between june and august 1993. filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. freeman described filming as tense, saying, \"most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. i remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those.\" freeman referred to darabont\\'s requiring multiple takes of scenes, which he considered had no discernible differences. for example, the scene where andy first approaches red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film and featured freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. the number of takes that were shot resulted in freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. robbins said that the long days were difficult. darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, \"a director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs.\" he found his most frequent struggles were with deakins. darabont favored more scenic shots, while deakins felt that not showing the outside of the prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.marvin spent five months scouting prisons across the united states and canada, looking for a site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. marvin eventually chose the ohio state reformatory in mansfield, ohio, to serve as the fictional shawshank state penitentiary in maine, citing its gothic-style stone and brick buildings. the facility had been shuttered three years earlier in 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.the 15-acre reformatory, housing its own power plant and farm, was partially torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cellblocks. several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden\\'s office, were shot in the reformatory. the interior of the boarding room used by brooks and red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on a sound stage built inside a nearby shuttered westinghouse electric factory. since darabont wanted the inmates\\' cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-built set housed in the westinghouse factory, except for the scene featuring elmo blatch\\'s admission of guilt for the crimes for which andy was convicted. it was filmed in one of the actual prison\\'s more confined cells. scenes were also filmed in mansfield, as well as neighboring ashland, ohio. the oak tree under which andy buries his letter to red was located near malabar farm state park, in lucas, ohio; it was destroyed by winds in 2016.\\njust as a prison in ohio stood in for a fictional one in maine, the beach scene showing andy and red\\'s reunion in zihuatanejo, mexico, was actually shot in the caribbean on the island of saint croix, one of the u.s. virgin islands. the beach at \\'zihuatanejo\\' is the sandy point national wildlife refuge, a protected area for leatherback sea turtles. scenes shot in upper sandusky included the prison wood shop scene where red and his fellow inmates hear the marriage of figaro (the woodshop is now called the shawshank woodshop), and the opening court scene which was shot at the wyandot county courthouse. other shooting locations included pugh cabin in malabar farm state park, where andy sits outside as his wife engages in an affair, butler, ohio, stood in for buxton, maine, and the bissman building in mansfield served as the halfway house where brooks stayed following his release.for the scene depicting andy\\'s escape from the prison, darabont envisioned andy using his miniature rock hammer to break into the sewage pipe, but he determined that this was not realistic. he opted instead to use a large piece of rock. while the film portrays the iconic scene of andy escaping to freedom through a sewer pipe described as a \"river of shit\", robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. the stream into which robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer terence marsh. the production team dammed the stream to make it deeper and used chlorination to partially decontaminate it. of the scene, robbins said, \"when you\\'re doing a film, you want to be a good soldier—you don\\'t want to be the one [who] gets in the way. so you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety.\" the scene was intended to be much longer and more dramatic, detailing andy\\'s escape across a field and onto a train, but with only a single night available to film the sequence, it was shortened to showing andy standing triumphant in the water. of his own work, deakins considers the scene to be one of his least favorite, saying that he \"over-lit\" it. in response, darabont disagreed with deakins\\' self-assessment. he said that the time and precision taken by deakins, and their limited filming schedule, meant he had to be precise in what he could film and how. in a 2019 interview, he stated that he regretted that this meant he could not film a close up of robbins\\' face as he climbed down out of the hole from his cell.as for the scene where andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was robbins\\' idea for andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. while in the finished film the inmates watch rita hayworth in gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching billy wilder\\'s the lost weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. as the footage was too costly to procure from paramount pictures, producer niki marvin approached the shawshank redemption\\'s domestic distribution rights-holder columbia pictures, which offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was gilda. as filming took place mainly in and around the prison, scenes were often shot in near chronological order respective of the different eras depicted throughout the story. this aided the actors\\' performances as their real-life relationships evolved alongside those of their respective characters. darabont commented that the scene in which andy tells red about his dreams of going to mexico, was one of the last filmed and one that he most revisited in recollecting on the film\\'s production. he praised robbins and freeman for completing the scene in only a few takes.',\n","  'the final cut of the theatrically released film runs for 142 minutes, and was dedicated to allen greene, darabont\\'s former agent, who died during filming from aids. the film\\'s first edit ran for nearly two and a half hours, which glotzer considered \"long\", and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of red adjusting to life after incarceration; darabont said that in test screenings the audience seemed to be getting impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that red would not make it. another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating andy\\'s escape tunnel; this was thought to slow down the action. the film originally had a cold open that played out andy\\'s crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more \"punchy\" opening. one scripted scene, which darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule. in the scene, a dreaming red is sucked into the poster of rita hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the pacific shore, saying \"i am terrified, there is no way home.\" darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.in darabont\\'s original vision for the end of the film, red is seen riding a bus towards the mexican border, leaving his fate ambiguous. glotzer insisted on including the scene of red and andy reuniting in zihuatanejo. she said darabont felt this was a \"commercial, sappy\" ending, but glotzer wanted the audience to see them together. castle rock agreed to finance filming for the scene without requiring its inclusion, guaranteeing darabont the final decision. the scene originally featured a longer reunion in which andy and red recited dialogue from their first meeting, but darabont said it had a \"golly-gee-ain\\'t-we-cute\" quality and excised it. the beach reunion was test audiences\\' favorite scene; both freeman and robbins felt it provided the necessary closure. darabont agreed to include the scene after seeing the test audience reactions, saying: \"i think it\\'s a magical and uplifting place for our characters to arrive at the end of their long saga...\"',\n","  'the film\\'s score was composed by thomas newman. he felt that it already elicited such strong emotions without music that he found it difficult to compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. the piece, \"shawshank redemption\", plays during andy\\'s escape from shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but darabont felt it had too much of a \"triumphal flourish\" and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. \"so was red\", played following red\\'s release from prison, and leading to his discovery of andy\\'s cache, became one of newman\\'s favorite pieces. the piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until newman reluctantly agreed to add harmonica—a reference to the harmonica red receives from andy to continue his message of hope. according to darabont, harmonica player tommy morgan \"casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take\", and this is heard in the finished film. newman\\'s score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.',\n","  'leading up to its release, the film was test screened with the public. these were described as \"through the roof\", and glotzer said they were some of the best she had seen. it was decided to mostly omit stephen king\\'s name from any advertising, as the studio wanted to attract a \"more prestigious audience\", who might reject a film from a writer known mostly for pulp fiction works such as the shining and cujo.following early september premieres at the renaissance theatre in mansfield, and the toronto international film festival, the shawshank redemption began a limited north american release on september 23, 1994. during its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. following a hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, darabont and glotzer went to the cinerama dome, but found no one there. glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask castle rock for a refund. while critics praised the film, glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the los angeles times pushed crowds away. it received a wide release on october 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number-nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy exit to eden ($3 million), and just ahead of the historical drama quiz show ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. the shawshank redemption closed in late november 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. it was considered a box-office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors\\' cuts.the film was also competing with pulp fiction ($108 million), which also premiered october 14 following its palme d\\'or award win, and forrest gump ($330 million), which was in the middle of a successful 42-week theatrical run. both films would become quotable cultural phenomena. a general audience trend towards action films starring the likes of bruce willis and arnold schwarzenegger was also considered to work against the commercial success of the shawshank redemption. freeman blamed the title, saying it was unmemorable, while robbins recalled fans asking: \"what was that shinkshonk reduction thing?\". several alternative titles had been posited before the release due to concerns that it was not a marketable title. the low box office was also blamed on a lack of female characters to broaden the audience demographics, the general unpopularity of prison films, and the bleak tone used in its marketing.after being nominated for several oscars in early 1995, the film was re-released between february and march, earning a further $12 million. in total, the film grossed $28.3 million in the united states and canada, and $45 million from other markets for a worldwide total of $73.3 million. in the united states, it became the 51st-highest-grossing film of 1994, and the 21st-highest-grossing r-rated film of 1994.'],\n"," 'uris': None,\n"," 'data': None,\n"," 'metadatas': [{'Section': 'Introduction',\n","   'Title': 'The

rita hayworth and shawshank redemption. the film tells the story of banker andy dufresne (tim robbins), who is sentenced to life in shawshank state penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler ellis \"red\" redding (morgan freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden samuel norton (bob gunton). william sadler, clancy brown, gil bellows, and james whitmore appear in supporting roles.\\ndarabont purchased the film rights to king\\'s story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. two weeks after submitting his script to castle rock entertainment, darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce the shawshank redemption, which started pre-production in january 1993. while the film is set in maine, principal photography took place from june to august 1993 almost entirely in mansfield, ohio, with the ohio state reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. the project attracted many stars for the role of andy, including tom hanks, tom cruise, and kevin costner. thomas newman provided the film\\'s score.\\nwhile the shawshank redemption received critical acclaim upon its release—particularly for its story, the performances of robbins and freeman, newman\\'s score, darabont\\'s direction and screenplay and roger deakins\\' cinematography—the film was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from the films pulp fiction and forrest gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. it went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven academy award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film\\'s box-office gross to $73.3 million.\\nover 320,000 vhs rental copies were shipped throughout the united states, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. the broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of castle rock by turner broadcasting system, and it was shown regularly on the tnt network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. decades after its release, the film was still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the most \"beloved\" films ever made. in 2015, the united states library of congress selected the film for preservation in the national film registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".',\n","  'in early 1947, portland, maine, banker andy dufresne arrives at shawshank state prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. he is befriended by ellis \"red\" redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a rock hammer and a large poster of rita hayworth for andy. assigned to work in the prison laundry, andy is frequently sexually assaulted by \"the sisters\" and their leader, bogs diamond.\\nin 1949, andy overhears the captain of the guards, byron hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. after an assault by the sisters nearly kills andy, hadley beats and cripples bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; andy is not attacked again. warden samuel norton meets andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate brooks hatlen, a front to use andy\\'s financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison\\'s decrepit library.\\nbrooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. the legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of the marriage of figaro; andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is punished with solitary confinement. after his release from solitary, andy explains to a dismissive red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. in 1963, norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. andy launders the money using the alias \"randall stephens\".\\nin 1965, andy and red befriend tommy williams, a young prisoner incarcerated for burglary. a year later, andy helps him pass his general educational development (ged) exam. tommy reveals to red and andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders of which andy was convicted. andy brings the information to norton who refuses to listen and, when andy mentions the money laundering, sends andy to solitary confinement and has hadley fatally shoot tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but norton threatens to destroy the library, remove andy\\'s protection by the guards, and move him to worse conditions. andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical red that he dreams of living in zihuatanejo, a mexican town on the pacific coast. andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near buxton, asking red to promise, once he is released, to retrieve a package that andy buried there. red worries about andy\\'s mental well-being, especially when he learns andy asked a fellow inmate for some rope.\\nat the next day\\'s roll call, the guards find andy\\'s cell empty. an irate norton throws a rock at a poster of raquel welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that andy had dug with his rock hammer over the past 19 years. the previous night, andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking norton\\'s suit, shoes, and ledger, containing evidence of the money laundering. while guards search for him, andy poses as randall stephens, withdraws over $370,000 of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at shawshank to a local newspaper. state police arrive at shawshank and take hadley into custody, while norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\\nthe following year, red is paroled after serving 40 years but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. remembering his promise to andy, he visits buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to zihuatanejo. red violates his parole by traveling to fort hancock, texas, and crossing the border into mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. he finds andy sanding an old boat on a zihuatanejo beach, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.'],\n"," 'uris': None,\n"," 'data': None,\n"," 'metadatas': [{'Section': 'Introduction',\n","   'Title': 'The Shawshank Redemption'},\n","  {'Section': 'Plot', 'Title': 'The

9.00/10. the website\\'s critics consensus reads, \"hard-hitting and stylish, goodfellas is a gangster classic—and arguably the high point of martin scorsese\\'s career.\" metacritic has assigned the film a weighted average score of 92 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of \"a−\" on an a+ to f scale.in his review for the chicago sun-times, roger ebert gave the film a full four stars and wrote, \"no finer film has ever been made about organized crime – not even the godfather.\" in his review for the chicago tribune, gene siskel wrote, \"all of the performances are first-rate; pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. goodfellas is easily one of the year\\'s best films.\" both named it as the best film of 1990. in his review for the new york times, vincent canby wrote, \"more than any earlier scorsese film, goodfellas is memorable for the ensemble nature of the performances... the movie has been beautifully cast from the leading roles to the bits. there is flash also in some of mr. scorsese\\'s directorial choices, including freeze frames, fast cutting and the occasional long tracking shot. none of it is superfluous.\" usa today gave the film four out of four stars and called it, \"great cinema—and also a whopping good time.\" david ansen, in his review for newsweek magazine, wrote \"every crisp minute of this long, teeming movie vibrates with outlaw energy.\" rex reed said, \"big, rich, powerful and explosive. one of scorsese\\'s best films! goodfellas is great entertainment.\" in his review for time, richard corliss wrote, \"so it is scorsese\\'s triumph that goodfellas offers the fastest, sharpest 2½-hr. ride in recent film history.\"',\n","   'the dark knight received critical acclaim. on rotten tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 345 critics, with an average score of 8.6/10. the consensus reads; \"dark, complex and unforgettable, the dark knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.\" on metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of \"a\" on an a+ to f scale.several publications called the dark knight the best comic-book hero adaptation ever made. roger ebert said it, alongside iron man, had redefined the potential of superhero films by combining comic-book tropes with real world events. some appreciated its complex moral tale about the effects of vigilantism and terrorism on contemporary society. emanuel levy and manohla dargis praised the depiction of the characters as possessing both positive and negative aspects, such as the batman\\'s efforts to end crime provoking unintended consequences and a greater response from criminals; dargis believed the dark knight\\'s exploration of chaos, fear, and death, following the september 11 attacks in 2001, represented \"that american movies have entered a new era of ambivalence when it comes to their heroes or maybe just superness.\" others criticized the dark, grim, intense, and self-serious tone as lacking any elements of fun or fantasy. david denby said the dark knight was a product of a \"time of terror\", but focused on embracing and unleashing it while cynically setting up a sequel. stephanie zacharek and david edelstein criticized a perceived lack of visual storytelling in favor of exposition, and aspects of the plot being difficult to follow amid the fast pace and loud score. christopher\\'s action direction was criticized, especially during fight scenes where it could be difficult to see things clearly, although the prologue bank heist was praised as among the film\\'s best.ledger\\'s performance received near-unanimous praise with the caveat that his death made the role both highly anticipated and difficult to watch. dargis, among others, described ledger as realizing the joker so convincingly, intensely, and viscerally it made the audience forget about the actor behind the makeup. the village voice wrote the performance would have made ledger a legend even if he had lived. other reviews said ledger outshone nicholson\\'s \"magnificent\" performance with macabre humor and malevolence. reviews generally agreed the joker was the best-written character, and that ledger commanded scenes from the entire cast to create one of the most mesmerizing cinematic villains. zacharek, however, lamented that the performance was not in service of a better film.bale\\'s reception was mixed; his performance was considered to be alternately \"captivating\" or serviceable, but ultimately uninteresting and undermined by portraying an immovable and generally unchanged character who delivers the batman\\'s dialogue in a hoarse, unvarying tone. eckhart\\'s performance was generally well received; reviewers praised his portrayal of dent as charismatic, and the character\\'s subsequent transformation into a sad, bitter \"monster\", although variety considered his subplot the film\\'s weakest. stephen hunter said the dent character was underwritten and that eckhart was incapable of portraying the role as intended. several reviewers regarded gyllenhaal as an improvement over holmes, although others said they found difficulty caring about the character and that gyllenhaal, while more talented than her predecessor, was miscast. peter travers praised oldman\\'s skill in making a virtuous character interesting and he, among others, described caine\\'s and freeman\\'s performances as \"effortless\". ebert surmised the entire cast provided \"powerful\" performances that engage the audience, such that \"we\\'re surprised how deeply the drama affects us\".',\n","   'the shawshank redemption opened to generally positive reviews. some reviewers compared the film to other well-received prison dramas, including birdman of alcatraz, cool hand luke, and riot in cell block 11. gene siskel said that, like one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest, the shawshank redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority. audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of \"a\" on an a+ to f scale.entertainment weekly\\'s owen gleiberman said that freeman makes the red character feel genuine and \"lived-in\". janet maslin of the new york times said that freeman was quietly impressive, but lamented that red\\'s role in the film had limited range, restricted to observing andy. she considered freeman\\'s commanding performance made him a much stronger figure than simply an observer. maslin said that freeman\\'s performance was especially moving when describing how dependent red had become on living within the prison walls. variety\\'s leonard klady suggested that freeman had the \"showier\" role, allowing him \"a grace and dignity that came naturally\", without ever becoming banal, and the washington post\\'s desson howe called freeman a \"master\" of comedic and poignant cadence. even kenneth turan\\'s los angeles times review, which glotzer credited with derailing the film\\'s box-office success, praised freeman, saying his \"effortless screen presence lends shawshank the closest thing to credibility it can manage\".of robbins\\' performance, gleiberman said that in his \"laconic-good-guy, neo-gary cooper role, [robbins] is unable to make andy connect with the audience\". conversely, maslin said that andy has the more subdued role, but that robbins portrays him intensely, and effectively depicts the character as he transitions from new prisoner to aged father figure, and klady stated that his \"riveting, unfussy ... precise, honest, and seamless\" performance anchors the film. howe said that while the character is \"cheesily messianic\" for easily charming everyone to his side, comparing him to \"forrest gump goes to jail\", robbins exudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell the story. the hollywood reporter stated that both freeman and robbins gave outstanding, layered performances that imbued their characters with individuality, and rolling stone\\'s peter travers said that the pair created something \"undeniably powerful and moving\". gunton and brown were deemed by klady as \"extremely credible in their villainy\", while howe countered that gunton\\'s warden was a clichéd character who extols religious virtues while having people murdered.maslin called the film an impressive directorial debut that tells a gentle tale with a surprising amount of loving care, while klady said the only failings came when darabont focused for too long on supporting characters, or embellished a secondary story. the hollywood reporter said that both the directing and writing were crisp, while criticizing the film\\'s long running time. klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by humor and unexpected events, would dampen the film\\'s mainstream appeal, but the story offered a fascinating portrait of the innate humanity of the inmates. gleiberman disliked that the prisoners\\' crimes were overlooked to portray them more as good guys. turan similarly objected to what he perceived as extreme violence and rape scenes, and making most of the prisoners seem like a \"bunch of swell and softhearted guys\" to cast the prison experience in a \"rosy glow\". klady summarized the film as \"estimable and haunting entertainment\", comparing it to a rough diamond with small flaws, but howe criticized it for deviating with multiple subplots, and pandering by choosing to resolve the story with andy and red\\'s reunion, rather than leaving the mystery. ebert noted that the story works because it is not about andy as the hero, but how red perceives him.deakins\\' cinematography was roundly praised, with the hollywood reporter calling it \"foreboding\" and \"well-crafted\", and travers saying \"the everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out ... you can almost feel the frustration and rage seeping into the skin of the inmates\". gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing \"the moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls\". the hollywood reporter said of newman\\'s score, \"at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film\\'s central theme\", and klady described it as \"the right balance between the somber and the absurd\".']],\n"," 'uris': None,\n"," 'data': None,\n"," 'metadatas': [[{'Section': 'Critical response', 'Title':

indicating \\\"universal acclaim\\\". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of \\\"a\\u2212\\\" on an a+ to f scale.in his review for the chicago sun-times, roger ebert gave the film a full four stars and wrote, \\\"no finer film has ever been made about organized crime \\u2013 not even the godfather.\\\" in his review for the chicago tribune, gene siskel wrote, \\\"all of the performances are first-rate; pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. goodfellas is easily one of the year's best films.\\\" both named it as the best film of 1990. in his review for the new york times, vincent canby wrote, \\\"more than any earlier scorsese film, goodfellas is memorable for the ensemble nature of the performances... the movie has been beautifully cast from the leading roles to the bits. there is flash also in some of mr. scorsese's directorial choices, including freeze frames, fast cutting and the occasional long tracking shot. none of it is superfluous.\\\" usa today gave the film four out of four stars and called it, \\\"great cinema\\u2014and also a whopping good time.\\\" david ansen, in his review for newsweek magazine, wrote \\\"every crisp minute of this long, teeming movie vibrates with outlaw energy.\\\" rex reed said, \\\"big, rich, powerful and explosive. one of scorsese's best films! goodfellas is great entertainment.\\\" in his review for time, richard corliss wrote, \\\"so it is scorsese's triumph that goodfellas offers the fastest, sharpest 2\\u00bd-hr. ride in recent film history.\\\"\",\n          \"the dark knight received critical acclaim. on rotten tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 345 critics, with an average score of 8.6/10. the consensus reads; \\\"dark, complex and unforgettable, the dark knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.\\\" on metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \\\"universal acclaim\\\". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of \\\"a\\\" on an a+ to f scale.several publications called the dark knight the best comic-book hero adaptation ever made. roger ebert said it, alongside iron man, had redefined the potential of superhero films by combining comic-book tropes with real world events. some appreciated its complex moral tale about the effects of vigilantism and terrorism on contemporary society. emanuel levy and manohla dargis praised the depiction of the characters as possessing both positive and negative aspects, such as the batman's efforts to end crime provoking unintended consequences and a greater response from criminals; dargis believed the dark knight's exploration of chaos, fear, and death, following the september 11 attacks in 2001, represented \\\"that american movies have entered a new era of ambivalence when it comes to their heroes or maybe just superness.\\\" others criticized the dark, grim, intense, and self-serious tone as lacking any elements of fun or fantasy. david denby said the dark knight was a product of a \\\"time of terror\\\", but focused on embracing and unleashing it while cynically setting up a sequel. stephanie zacharek and david edelstein criticized a perceived lack of visual storytelling in favor of exposition, and aspects of the plot being difficult to follow amid the fast pace and loud score. christopher's action direction was criticized, especially during fight scenes where it could be difficult to see things clearly, although the prologue bank heist was praised as among the film's best.ledger's performance received near-unanimous praise with the caveat that his death made the role both highly anticipated and difficult to watch. dargis, among others, described ledger as realizing the joker so convincingly, intensely, and viscerally it made the audience forget about the actor behind the makeup. the village voice wrote the performance would have made ledger a legend even if he had lived. other reviews said ledger outshone nicholson's \\\"magnificent\\\" performance with macabre humor and malevolence. reviews generally agreed the joker was the best-written character, and that ledger commanded scenes from the entire cast to create one of the most mesmerizing cinematic villains. zacharek, however, lamented that the performance was not in service of a better film.bale's reception was mixed; his performance was considered to be alternately \\\"captivating\\\" or serviceable, but ultimately uninteresting and undermined by portraying an immovable and generally unchanged character who delivers the batman's dialogue in a hoarse, unvarying tone. eckhart's performance was generally well received; reviewers praised his portrayal of dent as charismatic, and the character's subsequent transformation into a sad, bitter \\\"monster\\\", although variety considered his subplot the film's weakest. stephen hunter said the dent character was underwritten and that eckhart was incapable of portraying the role as intended. several reviewers regarded gyllenhaal as an improvement over holmes, although others said they found difficulty caring about the character and that gyllenhaal, while more talented than her predecessor, was miscast. peter travers praised oldman's skill in making a virtuous character interesting and he, among others, described caine's and freeman's performances as \\\"effortless\\\". ebert surmised the entire cast provided \\\"powerful\\\" performances that engage the audience, such that \\\"we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us\\\".\",\n          \"the shawshank redemption opened to generally positive reviews. some reviewers compared the film to other well-received prison dramas, including birdman of alcatraz, cool hand luke, and riot in cell block 11. gene siskel said that, like one flew over the cuckoo's nest, the shawshank redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority. audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of \\\"a\\\" on an a+ to f scale.entertainment weekly's owen gleiberman said that freeman makes the red character feel genuine and \\\"lived-in\\\". janet maslin of the new york times said that freeman was quietly impressive, but lamented that red's role in the film had limited range, restricted to observing andy. she considered freeman's commanding performance made him a much stronger figure than simply an observer. maslin said that freeman's performance was especially moving when describing how dependent red had become on living within the prison walls. variety's leonard klady suggested that freeman had the \\\"showier\\\" role, allowing him \\\"a grace and dignity that came naturally\\\", without ever becoming banal, and the washington post's desson howe called freeman a \\\"master\\\" of comedic and poignant cadence. even kenneth turan's los angeles times review, which glotzer credited with derailing the film's box-office success, praised freeman, saying his \\\"effortless screen presence lends shawshank the closest thing to credibility it can manage\\\".of robbins' performance, gleiberman said that in his \\\"laconic-good-guy, neo-gary cooper role, [robbins] is unable to make andy connect with the audience\\\". conversely, maslin said that andy has the more subdued role, but that robbins portrays him intensely, and effectively depicts the character as he transitions from new prisoner to aged father figure, and klady stated that his \\\"riveting, unfussy ... precise, honest, and seamless\\\" performance anchors the film. howe said that while the character is \\\"cheesily messianic\\\" for easily charming everyone to his side, comparing him to \\\"forrest gump goes to jail\\\", robbins exudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell the story. the hollywood reporter stated that both freeman and robbins gave outstanding, layered performances that imbued their characters with individuality, and rolling stone's peter travers said that the pair created something \\\"undeniably powerful and moving\\\". gunton and brown were deemed by klady as \\\"extremely credible in their villainy\\\", while howe countered that gunton's warden was a clich\\u00e9d character who extols religious virtues while having people murdered.maslin called the film an impressive directorial debut that tells a gentle tale with a surprising amount of loving care, while klady said the only failings came when darabont focused for too long on supporting characters, or embellished a secondary story. the hollywood reporter said that both the directing and writing were crisp, while criticizing the film's long running time. klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by humor and unexpected events, would dampen the film's mainstream appeal, but the story offered a fascinating portrait of the innate humanity of the inmates. gleiberman disliked that the prisoners' crimes were overlooked to portray them more as good guys. turan similarly objected to what he perceived as extreme violence and rape scenes, and making most of the prisoners seem like a \\\"bunch of swell and softhearted guys\\\" to cast the prison experience in a \\\"rosy glow\\\". klady summarized the film as \\\"estimable and haunting entertainment\\\", comparing it to a rough diamond with small flaws, but howe criticized it for deviating with multiple subplots, and pandering by choosing to resolve the story with andy and red's reunion, rather than leaving the mystery. ebert noted that the story works because it is not about andy as the hero, but how red perceives him.deakins' cinematography was roundly praised, with the hollywood reporter calling it \\\"foreboding\\\" and \\\"well-crafted\\\", and travers saying \\\"the everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out ... you can almost feel the frustration and rage seeping into the skin of the inmates\\\". gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing \\\"the moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls\\\". the hollywood reporter said of newman's score, \\\"at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film's central theme\\\", and klady described it as \\\"the right balance between the somber and the absurd\\\".\"\n        ],\n

given a wide release in north america on september 21, 1990.',\n","   'goodfellas is based on new york crime reporter nicholas pileggi\\'s book wiseguy. martin scorsese did not intend to make another mob film, but he saw a review of pileggi\\'s book, which he then read while working on the set of the color of money in 1986. he had always been fascinated by the mob lifestyle and was drawn to pileggi\\'s book because he thought it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read. after reading the book, scorsese knew what approach he wanted to take, \"to begin goodfellas like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer. i think it\\'s the only way you can really sense the exhilaration of the lifestyle, and to get a sense of why a lot of people are attracted to it.\" according to pileggi, scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, \"i\\'ve been waiting for this book my entire life,\" to which pileggi replied, \"i\\'ve been waiting for this phone call my entire life.\"scorsese decided to postpone making the film when funds materialized in 1988 to make the last temptation of christ. he was drawn to the documentary aspects of pileggi\\'s book. \"the book [wiseguy] gives you a sense of the day-to-day life, the tedium, how they work, how they take over certain nightclubs, and for what reasons. it shows how it\\'s done.\" he saw goodfellas as the third film in an unplanned trilogy of films that examined the lives of italian americans \"from slightly different angles.\" he has often described the film as \"a mob home movie\" that is about money, because \"that\\'s what they\\'re really in business for.\" two weeks in advance of the filming, the real henry hill was paid $480,000.',\n","   'goodfellas grossed $6.3 million from 1,070 theaters in opening weekend, topping the box office. in its second weekend the film made $5.9 million from 1,291 theaters, falling just 8% and finishing second behind newcomer

is based on new york crime reporter nicholas pileggi's book wiseguy. martin scorsese did not intend to make another mob film, but he saw a review of pileggi's book, which he then read while working on the set of the color of money in 1986. he had always been fascinated by the mob lifestyle and was drawn to pileggi's book because he thought it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read. after reading the book, scorsese knew what approach he wanted to take, \\\"to begin goodfellas like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer. i think it's the only way you can really sense the exhilaration of the lifestyle, and to get a sense of why a lot of people are attracted to it.\\\" according to pileggi, scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, \\\"i've been waiting for this book my entire life,\\\" to which pileggi replied, \\\"i've been waiting for this phone call my entire life.\\\"scorsese decided to postpone making the film when funds materialized in 1988 to make the last temptation of christ. he was drawn to the documentary aspects of pileggi's book. \\\"the book [wiseguy] gives you a sense of the day-to-day life, the tedium, how they work, how they take over certain nightclubs, and for what reasons. it shows how it's done.\\\" he saw goodfellas as the third film in an unplanned trilogy of films that examined the lives of italian americans \\\"from slightly different angles.\\\" he has often described the film as \\\"a mob home movie\\\" that is about money, because \\\"that's what they're really in business for.\\\" two weeks in advance of the filming, the real henry hill was paid $480,000.\",\n          \"goodfellas grossed $6.3 million from 1,070 theaters in opening weekend, topping the box

wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations... the screenplay by tarantino and roger avary so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it – the noses of those zombie writers who take \\'screenwriting\\' classes that teach them the formulas for \\'hit films\\'\". richard corliss of time wrote, \"it towers over the year\\'s other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool. it dares hollywood films to be this smart about going this far. if good directors accept tarantino\\'s implicit challenge, the movie theater could again be a great place to live in.\" in newsweek, david ansen wrote, \"the miracle of quentin tarantino\\'s pulp fiction is how, being composed of secondhand, debased parts, it succeeds in gleaming like something new.\" \"you get intoxicated by it,\" wrote entertainment weekly\\'s owen gleiberman, \"high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be. i\\'m not sure i\\'ve ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild-ass joy the way that tarantino does.\" \"there\\'s a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive\", wrote peter travers of rolling stone. \"pulp fiction is indisputably great.\"the los angeles times was one of the few major news outlets to publish a negative review on the film\\'s opening weekend. kenneth turan wrote, \"the writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who\\'s afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities.\" some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to pulp fiction itself. while not panning the film, stanley kauffmann of the new republic felt that \"the way that [it] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. pulp fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming.\" responding to comparisons between tarantino\\'s film and the work of french new wave director jean-luc godard, especially his first, most famous feature, jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader wrote, \"the fact that pulp fiction is garnering more extravagant raves than breathless ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful – namely, the ones we already have and don\\'t wish to expand.\" observing in the national review that \"[n]o film arrives with more advance hype\", john simon was unswayed: \"titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness\".debate about the film spread beyond the review pages, with its violence often being the theme. in the washington post, donna britt described how she was happy not to see pulp fiction on a recent weekend and thus avoid \"discussing the rousing scene in which a gunshot sprays somebody\\'s brains around a car interior\". some commentators took exception to the film\\'s frequent use of the word \"nigger\" (mentioned 18 times). in the chicago tribune, todd boyd argued that the word\\'s recurrence \"has the ability to signify the ultimate level of hipness for white males who have historically used their perception of black masculinity as the embodiment of cool\". in britain, james wood, writing in the guardian, set the tone for much subsequent criticism: \"tarantino represents the final triumph of postmodernism, which is to empty the artwork of all content, thus avoiding its capacity to do anything except helplessly represent our agonies ... only in this age could a writer as talented as tarantino produce artworks so vacuous, so entirely stripped of any politics, metaphysics, or moral interest.\"',\n","   'the dark knight received critical acclaim. on rotten tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 345 critics, with an average score of 8.6/10. the consensus reads; \"dark, complex and unforgettable, the dark knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.\" on metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of \"a\" on an a+ to f scale.several publications called the dark knight the best comic-book hero adaptation ever made. roger ebert said it, alongside iron man, had redefined the potential of superhero films by combining comic-book tropes with real world events. some appreciated its complex moral tale about the effects of vigilantism and terrorism on contemporary society. emanuel levy and manohla dargis praised the depiction of the characters as possessing both positive and negative aspects, such as the batman\\'s efforts to end crime provoking unintended consequences and a greater response from criminals; dargis believed the dark knight\\'s exploration of chaos, fear, and death, following the september 11 attacks in 2001, represented \"that american movies have entered a new era of ambivalence when it comes to their heroes or maybe just superness.\" others criticized the dark, grim, intense, and self-serious tone as lacking any elements of fun or fantasy. david denby said the dark knight was a product of a \"time of terror\", but focused on embracing and unleashing it while cynically setting up a sequel. stephanie zacharek and david edelstein criticized a perceived lack of visual storytelling in favor of exposition, and aspects of the plot being difficult to follow amid the fast pace and loud score. christopher\\'s action direction was criticized, especially during fight scenes where it could be difficult to see things clearly, although the prologue bank heist was praised as among the film\\'s best.ledger\\'s performance received near-unanimous praise with the caveat that his death made the role both highly anticipated and difficult to watch. dargis, among others, described ledger as realizing the joker so convincingly, intensely, and viscerally it made the audience forget about the actor behind the makeup. the village voice wrote the performance would have made ledger a legend even if he had lived. other reviews said ledger outshone nicholson\\'s \"magnificent\" performance with macabre humor and malevolence. reviews generally agreed the joker was the best-written character, and that ledger commanded scenes from the entire cast to create one of the most mesmerizing cinematic villains. zacharek, however, lamented that the performance was not in service of a better film.bale\\'s reception was mixed; his performance was considered to be alternately \"captivating\" or serviceable, but ultimately uninteresting and undermined by portraying an immovable and generally unchanged character who delivers the batman\\'s dialogue in a hoarse, unvarying tone. eckhart\\'s performance was generally well received; reviewers praised his portrayal of dent as charismatic, and the character\\'s subsequent transformation into a sad, bitter \"monster\", although variety considered his subplot the film\\'s weakest. stephen hunter said the dent character was underwritten and that eckhart was incapable of portraying the role as intended. several reviewers regarded gyllenhaal as an improvement over holmes, although others said they found difficulty caring about the character and that gyllenhaal, while more talented than her predecessor, was miscast. peter travers praised oldman\\'s skill in making a virtuous character interesting and he, among others, described caine\\'s and freeman\\'s performances as \"effortless\". ebert surmised the entire cast provided \"powerful\" performances that engage the audience, such that \"we\\'re surprised how deeply the drama affects us\".']],\n"," 'uris': None,\n"," 'data':

his review for the new york times, vincent canby wrote, \\\"more than any earlier scorsese film, goodfellas is memorable for the ensemble nature of the performances... the movie has been beautifully cast from the leading roles to the bits. there is flash also in some of mr. scorsese's directorial choices, including freeze frames, fast cutting and the occasional long tracking shot. none of it is superfluous.\\\" usa today gave the film four out of four stars and called it, \\\"great cinema\\u2014and also a whopping good time.\\\" david ansen, in his review for newsweek magazine, wrote \\\"every crisp minute of this long, teeming movie vibrates with outlaw energy.\\\" rex reed said, \\\"big, rich, powerful and explosive. one of scorsese's best films! goodfellas is great entertainment.\\\" in his review for time, richard corliss wrote, \\\"so it is scorsese's triumph that goodfellas offers the fastest, sharpest 2\\u00bd-hr. ride in recent film history.\\\"\",\n          \"on review aggregator rotten tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 110 reviews, with an average rating of 9.20/10. the website's critical consensus reads, \\\"one of the most influential films of the 1990s, pulp fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills, pitch-black humor, and pop-culture touchstones.\\\" on metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 94 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\\"universal acclaim\\\". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of \\\"b+\\\" on an a+ to f scale.the response of major american film reviewers was widely favorable. roger ebert called it \\\"a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations... the screenplay by tarantino and roger avary so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it \\u2013 the noses of those zombie writers who take 'screenwriting' classes that teach them the formulas for 'hit films'\\\". richard corliss of time wrote, \\\"it towers over the year's other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool. it dares hollywood films to be this smart about going this far. if good directors accept tarantino's implicit challenge, the movie theater could again be a great place to live in.\\\" in newsweek, david ansen wrote, \\\"the miracle of quentin tarantino's pulp fiction is how, being composed of secondhand, debased parts, it succeeds in gleaming like something new.\\\" \\\"you get intoxicated by it,\\\" wrote entertainment weekly's owen gleiberman, \\\"high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be. i'm not sure i've ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild-ass joy the way that tarantino does.\\\" \\\"there's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive\\\", wrote peter travers of rolling stone. \\\"pulp fiction is indisputably great.\\\"the los angeles times was one of the few major news outlets to publish a negative review on the film's opening weekend. kenneth turan wrote, \\\"the writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities.\\\" some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to pulp fiction itself. while not panning the film, stanley kauffmann of the new republic felt that \\\"the way that [it] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. pulp fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming.\\\" responding to comparisons between tarantino's film and the work of french new wave director jean-luc godard, especially his first, most famous feature, jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader wrote, \\\"the fact that pulp fiction is garnering more extravagant raves than breathless ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful \\u2013 namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand.\\\" observing in the national review that \\\"[n]o film arrives with more advance hype\\\", john simon was unswayed: \\\"titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness\\\".debate about the film spread beyond the review pages, with its violence often being the theme. in the washington post, donna britt described how she was happy not to see pulp fiction on a recent weekend and thus avoid \\\"discussing the rousing scene in which a gunshot sprays somebody's brains around a car interior\\\". some commentators took exception to the film's frequent use of the word \\\"nigger\\\" (mentioned 18 times). in the chicago tribune, todd boyd argued that the word's recurrence \\\"has the ability to signify the ultimate level of hipness for white males who have historically used their perception of black masculinity as the embodiment of cool\\\". in britain, james wood, writing in the guardian, set the tone for much subsequent criticism: \\\"tarantino represents the final triumph of postmodernism, which is to empty the artwork of all content, thus avoiding its capacity to do anything except helplessly represent our agonies ... only in this age could a writer as talented as tarantino produce artworks so vacuous, so entirely stripped of any politics, metaphysics, or moral interest.\\\"\",\n          \"the dark knight received critical acclaim. on rotten tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 345 critics, with an average score of 8.6/10. the consensus reads; \\\"dark, complex and unforgettable, the dark knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.\\\" on metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \\\"universal acclaim\\\". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of \\\"a\\\" on an a+ to f scale.several publications called the dark knight the best comic-book hero adaptation ever made. roger ebert said it, alongside iron man, had redefined the potential of superhero films by combining comic-book tropes with real world events. some appreciated its complex moral tale about the effects of vigilantism and terrorism on contemporary society. emanuel levy and manohla dargis praised the depiction of the characters as possessing both positive and negative aspects, such as the batman's efforts to end crime provoking unintended consequences and a greater response from criminals; dargis believed the dark knight's exploration of chaos, fear, and death, following the september 11 attacks in 2001, represented \\\"that american movies have entered a new era of ambivalence when it comes to their heroes or maybe just superness.\\\" others criticized the dark, grim, intense, and self-serious tone as lacking any elements of fun or fantasy. david denby said the dark knight was a product of a \\\"time of terror\\\", but focused on embracing and unleashing it while cynically setting up a sequel. stephanie zacharek and david edelstein criticized a perceived lack of visual storytelling in favor of exposition, and aspects of the plot being difficult to follow amid the fast pace and loud score. christopher's action direction was criticized, especially during fight scenes where it could be difficult to see things clearly, although the prologue bank heist was praised as among the film's best.ledger's performance received near-unanimous praise with the caveat that his death made the role both highly anticipated and difficult to watch. dargis, among others, described ledger as realizing the joker so convincingly, intensely, and viscerally it made the audience forget about the actor behind the makeup. the village voice wrote the performance would have made ledger a legend even if he had lived. other reviews said ledger outshone nicholson's \\\"magnificent\\\" performance with macabre humor and malevolence. reviews generally agreed the joker was the best-written character, and that ledger commanded scenes from the entire cast to create one of the most mesmerizing cinematic villains. zacharek, however, lamented that the performance was not in service of a better film.bale's reception was mixed; his performance was considered to be alternately \\\"captivating\\\" or serviceable, but ultimately uninteresting and undermined by portraying an immovable and generally unchanged character who delivers the batman's dialogue in a hoarse, unvarying tone. eckhart's performance was generally well received; reviewers praised his portrayal of dent as charismatic, and the character's subsequent transformation into a sad, bitter \\\"monster\\\", although variety considered his subplot the film's weakest. stephen hunter said the dent character was underwritten and that eckhart was incapable of portraying the role as intended. several reviewers regarded gyllenhaal as an improvement over holmes, although others said they found difficulty caring about the character and that gyllenhaal, while more talented than her predecessor, was miscast. peter travers praised oldman's skill in making a virtuous character interesting and he, among others, described caine's and freeman's performances as \\\"effortless\\\". ebert surmised the entire cast provided \\\"powerful\\\" performances that engage the audience, such that \\\"we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us\\\".\"\n        ],\n
